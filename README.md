### Goal of this action research: Master's dissertation in Advanced Computer Science

This work has been done by me during the past 3 months. It combines a few discipline that I'm highly interested in such as machine learning and cybersecurity.
Feel free to use my code for educational purpose, I'm available to answer any questions.

I will link my research paper as soon as it's approved by my institution.
