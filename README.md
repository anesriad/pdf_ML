### Dataset source: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/pdfmal-2022.html

### Goal of this action research: Master's dissertation in Advanced Computer Science

I have done this work during the second quarter of 2022. It combines a few disciplines I'm highly interested in such as machine learning and cybersecurity.
Feel free to use my code for educational purposes, I'm available to answer any questions.

The paper is available in PDF format. 
Reference using (Anas, 2022) and let me know on LinkedIn: Anas Riad.
